# localRestData

Basic Ionic2 Tab app that reads joke data from a REST service and displays jokes.

When clicking on a individual joke record it 
re-reads the record from REST service and 
stores the joke locally. 

If you click on the same joke/record again it reads it from local storage 

To run the app you need to have Ionic2 installed. Then type 'ionic serve' from the project root.
